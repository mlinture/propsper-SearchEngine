We improved the queries using the following techniques:
1. We used a tf-idf scoring to enhance the search results
2. We enhanced the index search time by implementing the "index of indices" 
   pointer that utilizes word positions
3. By assigning greater significance to words in bolded text or titles, 
   we were able to identify and prioritize more important information, 
   resulting in more relevant search results.
